  # E-Commerce Back End  ![Project License Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen)

  ## Description

  My challenge was to build the back end for an e-commerce site. I took a working Express.js API and configured it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. This was made during the U of U coding bootcamp.

  ## Installation

  After cloning the repository use the command `npm i` to install all npm dependencies. From there you will want to open your SQL command line and use the command `source db/schema.sql` to create the e-commerce database. You can then exit out of the SQL command line. Back in bash, use the command `npm run seed` to seed the newly create

  ## Usage

  To start the server use the command `node server.js`. Once it is running you can view all of routes in an API client like Insomnia Core. Below is a video demonstrating all of the routes created for this project.
